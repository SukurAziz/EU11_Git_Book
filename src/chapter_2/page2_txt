Caches can exist in various components of a computer system, such as the
processor itself (CPU cache), hard disk drives (disk cache), and web browsers
(browser cache). They play a crucial role in improving overall system performance
by reducing the time required to access frequently used data, thereby minimizing
 the impact of slower storage systems.
