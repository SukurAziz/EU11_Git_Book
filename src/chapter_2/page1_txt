Caches, in the context of computer systems, refer to a type of hardware or software
 component used to store frequently accessed data for quick retrieval. Caches are
 utilized to reduce the latency or delay in accessing data from slower storage
 or memory systems.


In a computer system, there are different levels of caches, typically organized
in a hierarchy. The levels are often denoted as L1, L2, L3, and so on. The cache
closest to the processor is typically the L1 cache, followed by the L2 cache,
and then the L3 cache. The purpose of this hierarchy is to provide faster access
to data that the processor frequently needs.


   Caches work based on the principle of locality, which suggests that if a particular
 piece of data is accessed once, it is likely to be accessed again in the near future.
 When the processor requests data, the cache checks if the data is already present in its storage. If it is, this is known as a cache hit, and the data is quickly retrieved. If the data is not present, it is known as a cache miss, and the cache must fetch the data from a slower memory or storage system.
